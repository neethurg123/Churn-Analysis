# Churn Analysis - Virtual Internship
This repository contains the work from a virtual internship project, where influential factors in customer churn for an energy source provider are explored. The project covers exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, and visual communication of insights using Python.

**Project Objectives**
1. Investigate the impact of different factors on customer churn.
2. Apply frameworks for exploratory data analysis.
3. Use Python to clean, process, and analyze client data.
4. Build predictive models to assess churn risk- Random Forest (for feature importance) with a cleaned and merged dataset
   - Data Set: data_for predictions.csv
   - Model: Random Forest model
   - Tunes hyperparameters using `GridSearchCV`
   - Evaluates performance with cross-validation
   - Evaluation: Using classification report and confusion matrix
6. Create data visualizations to highlight key trends.
